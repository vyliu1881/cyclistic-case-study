# Cyclistic Case Study: Data Processing and Cleaning

This README document provides an overview of the data processing and cleaning steps undertaken as part of the Cyclistic Case Study for my Google Professional Data Analytics certificate. The analysis aims to answer key business questions related to how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently and how to convert casual riders into annual members through data-driven insights.

## Overview

This documentation is for the Prepare and Process phases of the [data analysis process](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/six-data-analysis-phases-gert-l%C3%B5hmus/). This involves preparing and cleaning the raw data to make it suitable for further analysis. The case study follows a structured approach that includes the following steps:

1. **Data Sources**: Understanding the data sources and formats.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identifying and addressing data quality issues.
3. **Data Transformation**: Transforming and reformatting data for analysis.
4. **Data Preparation**: Preparing the cleaned data for in-depth analysis.

## Data Sources

The data for this analysis is sourced from Cyclistic's bike-sharing database. It includes information such as ride duration, start and end times, user types (annual members or casual riders), and other relevant attributes. You can access the data [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

## Data Cleaning

The data cleaning phase is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the analysis. Key data cleaning tasks include:

- Handling missing values.
- Removing duplicate records.
- Standardizing data formats.
- Correcting data anomalies.
  
## Data Transformation

Data transformation involves reshaping the data to make it suitable for analysis. This phase includes tasks such as:

- Extracting relevant features.
- Aggregating data for summary statistics.
- Creating derived variables for analysis.
- Converting data types if necessary.

## Data Preparation

In the data preparation phase, the cleaned and transformed data is structured for further analysis. This includes:

- Creating data subsets as needed for specific analyses.
- Splitting data into relevant categories (e.g., annual members and casual riders).
- Preparing datasets for data visualization and statistical analysis.

Throughout the data processing and cleaning phase, maintaining data integrity and documentation of all transformations is crucial for transparency and reproducibility.
